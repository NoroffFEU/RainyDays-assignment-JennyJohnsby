Rainy Days - Interactive Online Store üåßÔ∏è
This project is part of my JavaScript 1 - Course Assignment. The task was to build an interactive online store that fetches product data from an API and allows users to browse products, filter them by categories, and add/remove items from their shopping basket. The focus of the assignment is on the dynamic functionality provided by JavaScript and effective use of asynchronous actions (API calls).
üöÄ Overview
Rainy Days is a responsive online store built for users to explore a collection of rain gear products. The website dynamically loads products from an external API, providing features such as product filtering, adding products to a cart, and completing the checkout process. The site ensures a smooth and accessible user experience, with error handling and loading indicators for all asynchronous actions.

User Stories

Filter Products: Users can filter products by categories such as gender or type of rain gear.
Product Details: Each product has a dedicated page with detailed information.
Add to Cart: Users can add products to their shopping basket and view a cart summary.
Remove from Cart: Users can remove items from the cart.
Checkout: Users can view a summary of their cart and proceed with checkout.
Order Confirmation: After completing checkout, users are shown an order confirmation page with a thank you message.
üõ†Ô∏è Features

Cart System: Users can add and remove items from the cart, with the total cost automatically updated.
Checkout Process: Users can review their cart, proceed to checkout, and view a confirmation message once their order is completed.
Error Handling: Errors (e.g., API fetch issues) are handled gracefully, with user-friendly error messages.
Loading Indicators: Loading animations ensure the user knows when the site is fetching data asynchronously.
